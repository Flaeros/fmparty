I created this project long time ago to get hands on exprierence with android, and to create my own decent application.
I never worked with android before that. I did my best at that moment.
Currently application is not working, backed server is down and is not available in google play store.

Application was designed to be a service to help people meet each other with similar interests 
and spent time on some planned events or parties.
